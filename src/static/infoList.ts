According to the data of the World Health Organization, if some effective measures are not taken, China will have 28.7 million patients with skeletal diseases in 2030. In addition, the elderly are prone to fall or have the accidents, which further increases the risks of fracture and disability.The problems, to some extent, could be solved by exoskeleton robots. Therefore, there exists a very broad demanding space for exoskeleton robots in the market.This project is based on a wearable human exoskeleton equipment, intelligent sensors and high-performance embedded computing platform. The exoskeleton can understand the walking mode and cooperate with each users through a unique learning and training system designed for different individuals, so as to help disabilities.Ordinary exoskeletons are clumsy in helping the disability. So that the requirements for user's themselves are high, which means that Ordinary exoskeletons are not suitable for many Upper body disabilities as well as some serious patients. Due to the lack of all-round perception system and intelligent control system, exoskeleton does not have the perception and response of human brain, which leads to the disconnection between exoskeleton and human leg movement. The power-assisted mode of ordinary exoskeletons is single, so that ordinary exoskeletons are always unable to meet the needs of users, especially in the need of obstacles avoidance.In this project, the information of user's walking modes is collected by a variety of intelligent sensors. After the training and learning of machine learning algorithm, the current action purpose of the user can be judged in real time. The depth information is generated based on the depth learning algorithm in combination with binocular vision, and the edge information fed back by the obstacle recognition algorithm. Combined with different information, the real-time assistance mode is generated by the finite state machine, and the user's own leg movement is matched to complete obstacle avoidance.This project makes the exoskeleton more intelligent. In the scene of obstacle avoidance, compared with the ordinary exoskeleton, my intelligent exoskeleton improves the judgment of the obstacles, solves the problem that the exoskeleton assistance does not match the user's own motion, and improves the user's maladjustment to the foreign body like exoskeleton.

      'AR滤镜并非只停留在人们的想象中，它已经在各大社交平台中受到了人们的热捧。然而，许多人认为，AR滤镜并非只能停留在线上——它完全有可能像各类化妆品一样成为人们日常穿搭的一部分。基于这项假设，我们利用Holokit设备以及Spark AR 平台，对线下场景中的AR滤镜设计进行了探索。考虑到线下场景中多发的临场因素，通过情绪识别与动作识别来辅助用户进行自我表达，是我们主要的尝试方向。',

      "The AR filter does not just stay in people's imagination, it has been popular among the major social platforms. However, many people believe that AR filters are entirely possible to become a part of people's daily wear like various cosmetics. Based on this assumption, we used the Holokit device and the Spark AR platform to explore the AR filter design in offline scenes. Taking into account the frequent presence in offline scenes, assisting users to express themselves through emotion recognition and motion recognition is our main attempt.",
